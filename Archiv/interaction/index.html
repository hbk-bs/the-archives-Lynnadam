      <h2>Task</h2>
      <p> This task was all about creating interactive websites that didn’t really serve any practical purpose but provided the user with small moments of entertainment through simple interactions like clicking or hovering. </p>
<p> Pretty quickly, I realized that I had tons of ideas—but most of them were way too complex and ambitious for my current level of coding skills. While it’s easy to research solutions for every possible problem, I soon found myself overwhelmed by all the information and unable to really focus on or deepen my understanding of any specific concept. </p>
<p> A good example of this was the biggest project I worked on during this task: a sun that you can move across a mountain landscape with your mouse, while the color of the sky changes dynamically—from bright daytime to sunset to night. Just getting that to work was already a huge challenge because I had to figure out how to create smooth color transitions. I managed this by using a lerp function to interpolate between RGB values depending on the sun’s Y position, which allowed me to generate a smooth color gradient as the sun moved up and down. </p>
<p> But my mind said: “This shall just be the intro to a game.” So I decided to create a reaction game where you have to click on falling stars before they hit the ground. Building an entire game was a whole different level of complexity. This was also the first time I really worked with arrays, which were essential for managing all the stars appearing and disappearing on the screen. </p>
<p> All in all, this task really pulled me in—but it also taught me an important lesson: sometimes it’s better to keep an idea simple and just get it working before your vision punches you in the face. </p>
