      <h2>Task</h2>
      
<p>
  As part of our seminar on Physical Computing, we worked with
  <a href="https://hbk-bs.github.io/the-archives-Lynnadam/Archiv/blinkenlichten Arduino" target="_blank" class="text-link">Arduino</a> to explore the intersection of hardware and software. The assignment challenged us to repurpose an everyday object we already owned by enhancing it with sensors and LEDs. In collaboration with the other groups, we aimed to place all our individual projects within a shared context. We collectively decided on the theme 'A Street,' where all objects should maintain a consistent visual language—mainly using blue or grey materials, combined predominantly with red lights and unusual proportions. The overall effect was intended to evoke a sense of eerie or unsettling atmosphere. </p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        Our group chose to reimagine a classic construction site warning light—apparently an everyday object. The <a href="https://hbk-bs.github.io/the-archives-Lynnadam/Archiv/blinkenlichten Code" target="_blank" class="text-link">Code</a> development process went smoothly, but the analog assembly presented several challenges. In particular, soldering components onto the circuit board proved tricky, often leading to unexpected malfunctions. In the end, I must have replaced and re-soldered at least four resistors as issues kept arising. However, this process reignited a forgotten passion of mine for soldering, which is quite great. And through repeated refinement and simplification of our setup, we successfully completed our project.

      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>
        The final version of our modified construction lamp was able to detect how close a person was thanks to an integrated distance sensor. The closer someone approached, the faster and more intensely the red warning light would flash, creating an immediate feedback system. In this way, we were able to contribute a functional object to the "A Street" project.
