      <h2>Task</h2>
      <p>
        As part of our seminar on Physical Computing, we worked with
        <a href="https://hbk-bs.github.io/the-archives-Lynnadam/Archiv/blinkenlichten Arduino" target="_blank" class="text-link">Arduino</a> microcontrollers to explore the intersection of hardware and software in creative ways. The assignment challenged us to repurpose an everyday object we already owned by enhancing it with sensors and LEDs. In collaboration with other groups, we aimed to place all our individual projects within a shared context. We collectively decided on the theme of “A Street,” where all objects would feature a consistent visual language—predominantly blue or grey materials combined with striking red lights.

      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <p>
        Our group chose to reimagine a classic construction site warning light—an object commonly found at home. The <a href="https://hbk-bs.github.io/the-archives-Lynnadam/Archiv/blinkenlichten Code" target="_blank" class="text-link">Code</a> development process went smoothly, but the analog assembly presented several challenges. In particular, soldering components onto the circuit board proved tricky, often leading to unexpected malfunctions. I ended up replacing and re-soldering resistors multiple times as issues kept arising. However, this hands-on process reignited a forgotten passion of mine for soldering and working with electronics. Through repeated refinement and simplification of our setup, we managed to develop a reliable and functional prototype.

      <h2>Result</h2>
      <p>The final version of our modified construction lamp was both intuitive and effective. Thanks to an integrated distance sensor, the light could detect how close someone was standing. The nearer a person approached, the faster and more intensely the red warning light would flash—creating an immediate and impactful feedback system. Our repurposed object seamlessly fit into the overall aesthetic of the group project and added a dynamic, interactive element to our conceptual “Street.”</p>
